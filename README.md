# Game Developement Assignment 1 by David Rami and Miquel Quintana 
Plataformer game developed by 2 students of the CITM university in Barcelona in the Game Developement subject of their 2nd year

# SUBSYSTEMS
The game works using modules to manage every aspect of the game (rendering, collisions, entities, UI, scenes, etc), the entities and UI elements are structured in a reverse tree of classes, as an innovation our Animation system is automatized due to the premeditated 
distribution of de sprites, also the colliders are loaded by tilesets in Tiled, however that generates a lot of colliders that remain unused for a long time so they get processed only when they are within a certain radius of the player.
